Things to do:
--check the boolean logic statements to make sure they make some sense
-let the user specify the amount of solutions they would like to have, or allow more
solutions for files with more shapes.
-let the user pick the starting and ending points. ( if we do this, we have to make sure the user does'nt pick a point in a shape.  This would not allow us to ever get a correct solution.)
